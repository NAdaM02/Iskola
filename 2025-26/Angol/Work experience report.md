## My Experience Working at Eco-friendly Robot Designs

As a college student from Europe I found it extremely valuable to get familiar with the professional working environment here in the USA. After searching extensively for the right job in robotics, I came across an exceptional opportunity at Eco-friendly robot designs. Since then I have spent six months at this local company working two days a week and it was highly rewarding.

Before starting, I had to sign a contract with the company. This was overwhelming at first as I had no previous experience such as this. However, doing so successfully felt like a great achievement.

The work itself was very engaging; my task was to design and build various robots <u>in a team</u> that helped the environment in some way. One time, I helped create the arm of an autonomous robot that picks up garbage and collects it in its container. Another time, I wrote the movement software of a fire surveillance drone. My studies proved very useful using the tools, techniques and software I learnt so much about in class, and these projects only solidified my knowledge further.

Overall, this experience taught me a great deal and helped me shape my expectations for future workplaces.

For future organised work experiences I would suggest that the university provide a program to help search for <u>work</u> opportunities. In addition it would also be of great help if the university offered guidance to understanding job contracts.
